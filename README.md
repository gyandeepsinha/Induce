How to run the clone program in your system
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am assuming that you have installed all the required setup for the project.
step-1    : open your command prompt and type 'monogd' command to start Database server.

step-2    : open command prompt and reach to your project folder and write node <project main file name>
            node app.js (In my case my main file name is app.js).
            
step-3    : command prompt will show message that your server is running on <this server port>.
            Your server is running on PORT 7070 (In my case i have setup and allocat PORT 7070 to project).

Hope it will work fine.

Regards.
Team.
